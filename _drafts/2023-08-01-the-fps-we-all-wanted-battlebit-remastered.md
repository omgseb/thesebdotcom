### Battle-what?

By all internet standards this is old news, but BattleBit Remastered is fantastic and is my latest obesssion. This game has all the good stuff with none of the bad stuff. Okay, some bad stuff, but so much good stuff that it completely outshines the bad. Developed and published by [just a](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=SgtOkiDoki&snr=1_5_9__2000) [few](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Vilaskis&snr=1_5_9__2000) [people](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=TheLiquidHorse&snr=1_5_9__2000) listed on the [BattleBit Remastered Steam store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/671860/BattleBit_Remastered/), they've managed to come up with a 127 vs. 127 multiplayer first-person-shooter with environmental destruction and detalied gunplay that rivals all triple-A titles to date. In no particular order, some comments:

### Graphics

Everyone is convinced this game looks like Roblox, and they're right. BattleBit Remastered does not have any next-gen graphics with which to speak, and that seems to be entirely intentional. There's not much to say here except that the graphics convey only what they should and just vaguely represent real-life objects through overall shape and color-shading. The upside to the plainness is that it'll run on just about any PC even remotely close to being "gaming" spec: the requirements are low, and the frames per second are high.

### Voice Chat

Proximity voice chat for _both teams_ is absolutely critical here. Some of the best moments would never have happened without it. Have a listen to what happens when this player encounters two enemies, one dead and one AFK:
